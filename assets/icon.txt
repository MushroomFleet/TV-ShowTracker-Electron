This is a placeholder for the icon file.

For a production application, you would want to:
1. Create an icon.png file (256x256 pixels recommended)
2. Place it in this assets folder
3. The icon should be referenced in main.js

You can use tools like:
- Adobe Illustrator
- Figma
- GIMP
- Or an online icon creator

The icon serves as the application icon in the taskbar, window title, and OS application listings.
